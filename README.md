# huffmanCoding
Huffman coding project from a data structures course taken at Montana State University.

Program reads a plain text file, creates a huffman tree from said file, converts the file, and then converts it back.

Planned future work on this project includes saving the huffman tree in a file so the encoded text file may be converted back
at a later point.
